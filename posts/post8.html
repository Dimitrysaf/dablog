            <h1>Why polar bears are no longer the poster image of climate change</h1>

                For decades distressed polar bears on distant <br>
                ice caps were an emblem for climate change – until experts <br>
                began to doubt the effectiveness of these visuals.The<br>
                <br><br>
                With mangey, discoloured fur and a gaunt frame the <br>
                bear dragged its feet, taking slow and laboured movements. <br>
                At one point, it paused, to scavenge for food in an <br>
                abandoned barrel – chewing on the foam seat <br>
                of a snowmobile, which had been burned and tossed away.<br>
                <br><br>
                "It was so heartbreaking to watch this animal, probably <br>
                in its last few minutes of life," said Mittermeier, who shot <br>
                what would later become one of the decade's most viral – and <br>
                controversial – polar bear images.<br>
                <br><br>
                In December 2017, her image, and Nicklen's accompanying <br>
                video footage, were published in National Geographic Magazine, <br>
                overlaid with subtitles suggesting: "This is what climate change <br>
                looks like". The scene in the Baffin Islands became a sensation, <br>
                quickly clocking up an estimated 2.5 billion views, and fuelling <br>
                a global discussion about the threat of melting ice caps and global warming.<br>
                <br><br>
                Images of distressed polar bears clinging to ice floes or in <br>
                far-flung Arctic landscapes have become instantly recognisable as <br>
                emblems for the climate crisis. However, over the last decade, <br>
                scientists, campaigners and news desks have begun to drift away from <br>
                these visuals, questioning if they really paint a realistic image of climate change.<br>
