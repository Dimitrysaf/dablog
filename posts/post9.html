            <h1>Beavers released into Wyre Forest</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="postContent">
            <p>
                A family of beavers have been released into an enclosure in <br>
                Wyre Forest in an attempt to bring the species back to the nationâ€™s forests.<br>
                <br><br>
                Two adults and four kits have been moved <br>
                from Scotland into the five-hectare enclosure in Worcestershire.<br>
                <br><br>
                Forestry England say the enclosure is hoped to <br>
                encourage the family to establish a home in the <br>
                location selected for them along a tributary close to the Dowles Brook.<br>
                <br><br>
                Sam Pegler, senior ecologist for Forestry England said: <br>
                "We look forward to seeing the benefits our new beaver <br>
                \family can bring to the natural environment, as we <br>
                continue our work of recovering and restoring vital ecosystems."<br>
                <br><br>
                Beavers were once widespread throughout Britain, <br>
                but were hunted to near-extinction by the 16th Century.<br>
                <br><br>
                Today, the animals are a protected species and successful <br>
                reintroductions are taking place across the country, Forestry England said.<br>
                <br><br>
                According to Forestry England, <br>
                beavers play an important role in wetland ecology.<br>
                <br><br>
                When beavers fell trees it provides habitat for <br>
                fungi and insects, as well as allowing more light to <br>
                reach the water, which has been shown to increase breeding <br>
                in amphibians and water-based insects.<br>
                <br><br>
                Their dams can also help to reduce flooding as <br>
                these natural pools hold larger volumes of water and <br>
                they are not watertight so slowly release water reducing the flow downstream.<br>
