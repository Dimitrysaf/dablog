            <h1>Solar eclipse 2024: When and where is the next eclipse in the US?</h1>

            <p>
                Tens of millions of people across the US, <br>
                Canada and Mexico were treated to a total solar eclipse on Monday.<br>
                <br><br>
                Whole cities were plunged into darkness as the Moon briefly <br>
                blocked out the Sun's rays in areas along what is known as the path of totality.<br>
                <br><br>
                Awestruck stargazers - or those who missed the event <br>
                because of cloud cover or other commitments - now want to <br>
                know when the phenomenon can next be observed.<br>
                <br><br>
                This time, the interval will be much longer than the previous <br>
                six-year wait. The next total eclipse in the contiguous United States <br>
                will not happen for more than 20 years - and will be much more fleeting.<br>
