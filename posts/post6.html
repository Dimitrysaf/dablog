            <h1>How a fictitious 'sea' became a top Maldivian tourist attraction</h1>

                A glittering expanse of the Indian Ocean glowed blue in the dark as if the <br>
                stars were submerged underwater after falling from the sky. Along the shoreline, more tiny <br>
                star-like dots were swept up by waves and tumbled onto the beach, lighting up the wet sand like <br>
                a reflection of the night sky. They disappeared into the shadows in mere moments. I bounded across <br>
                the beach and turned round to see my footprints rekindling the lights, leaving a glowing trail behind me. <br>
                Dipping my toe into the twinkling blue water, the brightness intensified, like a swirling galaxy.<br>
                <br><br>
                This incredible sight, commonly known as the "Sea of Stars", <br>
                is one of the highest-rated attractions in the Maldives. Stunning <br>
                images of it proliferate online, inspiring adventurous travellers to seek it out. <br>
                But few people can agree on exactly where you can find the Maldives' Sea of Stars.<br>
                <br><br>
                That's because the Sea of Stars does not actually exist.<br>
                <br><br>
                To clarify, the Maldives' mysterious Sea of Stars does not exist as a <br>
                geographical location. The simple reason for this is that these magical-looking <br>
                lights are bioluminescent plankton that bob around the ocean.<br>
                <br><br>
                "When people say they want to see the Sea of Stars in the Maldives, <br>
                they are actually asking to see a chemical reaction – it's bioluminescent plankton," <br>
                said marine biologist and wildlife presenter Lauren Arthur, who worked in the Maldives for <br>
                eight years and recently returned to film sea life.<br>
                <br><br>
                She explained that bioluminescence is a chemical reaction whereby <br>
                light is produced, while plankton is a collective term for microscopic <br>
                organisms that can't control their movements – they just float around in currents. <br>
                Not all plankton is capable of emitting light (only specific species can), but even then, <br>
                they don't emit light all the time, only when they are disturbed, she added. <br>
                "There's no one specific place to find bioluminescent plankton. It can be found <br>
                anywhere in the Maldives, or even anywhere around the world where you get plankton, <br>
                even the United Kingdom.<br>
