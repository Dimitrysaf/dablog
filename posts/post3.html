                Set in a stunning valley, this ancient desert oasis has birthed flourishing civilisations. <br>
                Now, after years of being closed to outsiders, it's starting to reveal its secrets.<br>
                <br><br>
                As a photographer, I've always been drawn to the unique way that light in the desert stretches, <br>
                bounces off the sand and rock and illuminates the plains. There is a stillness in these landscapes that <br>
                I've come to crave, but I'm also fascinated by the relationships people build with deserts. <br>
                In the Middle East, humans have found ways to survive and even thrive in these harsh environments <br>
                for millennia, and perhaps nowhere is this ingenuity more evident than in one of the Arabian Peninsula's <br>
                most significant cultural cradles: AlUla (sometimes written "al-Ula"). <br>
                <br><br>
                Set in the AlUla Valley amid the soaring sandstone and granite mountains of <br>
                north-western Saudi Arabia's Hijaz region, this ancient desert oasis has <br>
                supported human life for the past 200,000 years. The area's fertile soil <br>
                and access to water amid the arid, mountainous desert helped multiple civilisations blossom. <br>
                The Dadan and Lihyan kingdoms that flourished here between 800 and 100 BCE were followed by Hegra, <br>
                an important city in the Nabataean civilisation whose capital, Petra, was located farther north, in modern-day Jordan. <br>
                <br><br>
                Yet, it wasn't until 2019 when Saudi Arabia began issuing tourist visas for non-religious travel <br>
                that foreign visitors were able to witness this long closed-off and unexplored valley. <br>
                Today, echoes of AlUla's long and mysterious past are everywhere, and as archaeologists <br>
                slowly begin to uncover the many burial mounds, tombs and rock inscriptions scattered throughout <br>
                AlUla's numerous sites, this ancient oasis is finally starting to reveal its secrets.<br>
