            <h1>Florida is paying bounty hunters to control its python population</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="postContent">
            <p>
                Amy Siewe – or the python huntress as she's also known – is scanning the <br>
                roads and grassy verges of South Florida. She's after a legendary 20 footer – <br>
                a 6m-long invasive Burmese python, slithering through the grass in search of <br>
                prey to strangle and consume. "You never know when that girl is gonna be coming <br>
                across the road, so you wanna be there for it," she says.<br>
                <br><br>
                In the winter, Siewe hunts invasive pythons by day. But in the humid, <br>
                sweltering South Florida summer, she hunts by night, crouched in the back <br>
                of her huge truck, goggles on to protect against bugs, eyes keenly trained <br>
                to the roadsides, hoping to catch a tell-tale flash of scales slithering across <br>
                the road, from woods to the canals. For Siewe, the dangerous job is not just <br>
                about the thrill of the chase. It's also about saving a whole ecosystem.<br>
                <br><br>
                Burmese pythons are thought to have come to Florida as pets in the mid-1990s. <br>
                From 1996 to 2006, around 99,000 pythons were brought to the US to be sold as pets. <br>
                When some escaped into the wild, they found a python paradise rich in prey such as mice, <br>
                squirrels and birds – but also, large animals including deer and even alligators. <br>
                The pythons are thought to hunt by using their sense of smell to identify trails <br>
                left by their prey, then hiding nearby to ambush them, squeeze them to death, and swallow them whole. <br>
