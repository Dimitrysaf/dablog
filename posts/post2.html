            <h1>Enhanced Games: The mind behind the 'doped Olympics'</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="postContent">
            <p>
                Move fast and break things.<br>
                <br><br>
                In the early years of the new millennium, <br>
                as Mark Zuckerberg was turning Facebook <br>
                from dorm room hustle into a ground-breaking <br>
                billion-dollar company, he adopted a motto.<br>
                <br><br>
                He told colleagues to act first and apologise later. <br>
                Old orthodoxies should be shattered, rivals dented and <br>
                establishment egos bruised in pursuit of a project that <br>
                justified it all.<br>
                <br><br>
                It became the disrupter's mantra, a philosophy that could <br>
                turn a bright idea into a glittering fortune in a twinkle.<br>
                <br><br>
                Now, Aron D'Souza is making the same offer to the world's <br>
                best athletes.<br>
                <br><br>
                The Enhanced Games has put million-dollar bounties <br>
                on world records: move fast, break records and you can earn big.<br>
                <br><br>
                The catch that has hooked headlines around the world <br>
                is that competitors can use performance-enhancing drugs to do so.<br>
                <br><br>
                The Enhanced Games, which plans its first edition for <br>
                2025, will have no drug testing. It will be a pharmaceutical <br>
                free-for-all, with participants free to pump, juice and dope <br>
                however they see fit.<br>
                <br><br>
                Plenty say it shouldn't happen.<br>
                <br><br>
                Travis Tygart, the chief executive of the United States <br>
                Anti-Doping Agency, has called it "a dangerous clown show". <br>
                Two-time Olympic champion Kieran Perkins said it was <br>
                "borderline criminal". World Athletics president Lord Coe <br>
                was uncharacteristically (and unrepeatably) blunt when asked <br>
                his opinion.<br>
                <br><br>
                Others say that it won't happen anyway, <br>
                that the logistics and legalities are insurmountable. <br>
                They believe the Enhanced Games is a provocation or a <br>
                publicity stunt, rather than a realistic prospect.<br>
                <br><br>
                But D'Souza is adamant.<br>
                <br><br>
                "It will happen," says the Enhanced Games founder.<br>
                <br><br>
                "I wouldn't dedicate my life, years of my team's <br>
                lives and millions of dollars from the world's greatest <br>
                investors unless we truly believe we can deliver the event, <br>
                break world records and fundamentally change the <br>
                trajectory of not just sport, but humanity as a whole.<br>
                <br><br>
                "We are doing something truly extraordinary, something that is shaping the future."
                
                It is an audacious pitch. But it isn't De Souza's first.
