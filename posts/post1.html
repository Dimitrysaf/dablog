            <h1>What do terracotta warriors tell us about life in ancient China?</h1>

                Fifty years after they were discovered, <br>
                China's famous clay figurines are giving up their secrets.
                <br><br>
                They don't talk. They can't move. But the enigmatic <br>
                terracotta warriors of China are excellent storytellers.
                <br><br>
                Since they were accidentally discovered 50 years ago by a group <br>
                of farmers digging a well, these life-size clay figurines have <br>
                revealed intriguing details about the soldiers of Qin â€“ the feudal state <br>
                that unified China, for the first time in 221BC under the country's first emperor Qin Shi Huang.
                <br><br>
                Detailed examination of the warriors, which were discovered in buried pits <br>
                to the northeast of Xi'an near the tomb of the emperor, have shed light on what <br>
                life during the ancient Qin Dynasty was like, from the clothes people wore to where <br>
                soldiers in the army were from.
                <br><br>
                Shoes may not be the first thing one would notice of these 2,200-year-old <br>
                sculptures, armed with real weapons and arranged in military formation to guard <br>
                Qin Shi Huang in his afterlife. But a preliminary analysis of their footwear <br>
                showed that these humble accessories might have played a "vital role" in the <br>
                Qin army, and contributed to their ability to achieve victory after victory.
                <br><br>
                Two Chinese researchers behind the study, which has yet to be peer-reviewed <br>
                 published in a scientific journal, analysed the shoes of a kneeling archer, <br>
                 the only type of terracotta warriors excavated so far which reveals the sole <br>
                 of their shoes. They then made a copy of the footwear using the shoe-making <br>
                 techniques and materials known to be used by the Qin people when the warriors were constructed.
