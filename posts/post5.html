            <p>
                The large, grey, barnacled Florida manatees lazily float <br>
                near the surface of the sheltered canal next to Apollo Beach, <br>
                on the state's Gulf Coast.<br>
                <br><br>
                The water is heated to the perfect temperature for the manatees, who can't <br>
                survive in conditions below 20C (68F). The manatees' natural habitats are <br>
                the warm water springs found across Florida, where the mammals spend up to eight <br>
                hours a day grazing on seagrass.<br>
                <br><br>
                But these Apollo Beach manatees – also affectionately referred to as <br>
                "sea cows" – aren't feeding off the seafloor of aquamarine artesian springs, <br>
                which are lined with limestone rock and surrounded by Spanish moss-draped trees. <br>
                Instead, a large coal power plant looms over the creatures, pumping out warm water – an industry by-product.<br>
